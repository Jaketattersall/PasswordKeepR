1. Read requirements carefully and write User Stories. 

As a user, I want to store passwords, because I am forgetful. 

As a signed-in user, I want to be able to access websites where I stored my passwords, because I want to reference the sites that I have my information to. 

2. Nouns - Database Tables

User | passwords | different sites


3. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Consider where things belong (which folders) 
Use the node-skeleton repo to get started and establish these
